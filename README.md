### Required Deliverables

* Your modified source file, `src/midterm_2023.R` in which your code may be run without bugs.

### Checks for GatorGrader

For immediate feedback on submissions, we will be using Gator Grade to inform the of missing components in the submission. As you submit, you will notice that there is a thick red X that will change to a green check mark when all components have been included in the submission. You are encouraged to click on the red X to find a listing of the components to address.

## Project Assessment

The grade that a student receives on this assignment will have the following components.

- **GitHub Actions CI Build Status [up to 15%]:**: For the lab repository associated with this assignment students will receive a checkmark grade if their last before-the-deadline build passes. This is only checking some baseline writing and commit requirements as well as correct running of the program. An additional reduction will given if the commit log shows a cluster of commits at the end clearly used just to pass this requirement. An addition reduction will also be given if there is no commit during lab work times. All other requirements are evaluated manually.

- **Mastery of Technical Knowledge and Skills [up to 85%]**: Students will receive a portion of their assignment grade when their program implementation reveals that they have mastered all of the technical knowledge and skills developed during the completion of this assignment. As a part of this grade, the instructor will assess aspects of the programming including, but not limited to, the completeness and the correctness of the program and the use of effective source code comments.

## GatorGrade

You can check the baseline writing and commit requirements for this lab assignment by running department's assignment checking `gatorgrade` tool. To use `gatorgrade`, you first need to make sure you have Python3 installed (type `python --version` to check). If you do not have Python installed, please see:

- [Setting Up Python on Windows](https://realpython.com/lessons/python-windows-setup/)
- [Python 3 Installation and Setup Guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
- [How to Install Python 3 and Set Up a Local Programming Environment on Windows 10](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-on-windows-10)

Then, if you have not done so already, you need to install `gatorgrade`:

- First, [install `pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/)
- Then, install `gatorgrade` with `pipx install gatorgrade`

Finally, you can run `gatorgrade`:

`gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml`

## Submitting Your Work
